this app uses http://api.marketstack.com/v1/tickers
with specific parameters as i got from the mail, like 10 random companies i picked them, search parameter you can use search field to try it and finally dateFrom dateTo
to specify the date range.
you didn't mention anything about which specific api to use but i read the documentation of marketstack and got some info that helped me to build this result.
and also you didn't spicify the design so i made the app by simple ui design.
